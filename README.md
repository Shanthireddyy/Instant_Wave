
The Instant Wave Communication project is a web application for real-time video conferencing, similar to Zoom. It uses Next.js for dynamic routing and scalable web development, and TypeScript for strong typing and error reduction. The UI is designed with Shadcn for customizable and accessible components. On the backend, ClerkJS handles user authentication and management, supporting registration and login via email/password or third-party services. Stream.io powers real-time chat, video, and audio functionalities. Key features include meeting scheduling, admin controls, live emoji reactions, screen sharing, and user management. The project integrates these technologies to provide a seamless and feature-rich communication experience.
